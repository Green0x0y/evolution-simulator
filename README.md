# Evolution Simulator

## Project description

The application simulates evolution of animals in a selected map scenario. Certain aspects of the simulation are configurable and can strongly influence its course. Some of the configurable parameters are simple numerical values, such as the initial population size, while others significantly change the rules of the simulation. This mainly concerns the functioning of the map, plant growth, mutation and animal behavior. The program allows saving simulation statistics in a CSV file.
